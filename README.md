Preview of the application is available on Github Pages: https://moskopio.github.io/blood-view


**Note**: Due to CORSA limitation and issues with Github Pages proxy settings, functionality to load data from remote mock server is currently not working on Github Pages hosted preview.

As an alternative way to test the application, a set of mock test data is available in the repository in form of JSON file: https://github.com/moskopio/blood-view/blob/master/testData.json

While running the application locally, the option to fetch data from a remote server should work without any issues.


### Installation:
```
yarn
```

### Running Locally:
